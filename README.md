# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scope of this project consisted of pulling data from years of successful and unsuccessful kickstarters. I ran different filters, looked at data through graphing, and created multiple spreadsheets. Everything worked together to create a clear and concise conclusion.

### Purpose
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this project was to perform analysis on Kickerstarter data to uncover trends. We can observe trends based off of launch date and goals. By plotting this data we can see success or failure and use this for future marketing campaigns.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A challenge I encountered was experimenting with the right data structures. I wanted to understand what the data was actually saying and sometimes that was difficult to interpret. Other challenges were making sure every piece of code was accurate and every chart displayed the correct information.

### Results:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the data, a theater themed kickstarter has some details you should pay attention to. If you start in May, you will more than double your chances of success, while success rates significantly decrease in December. Keeping your goal under $5000 gives you the most favorable outcome. However, a limitation of this dataset is that we only have data from years 2009 through 2017. This makes it a relatively small sample size. Another graph we could look into is outcomes based on location. In conclusion, theater is a great way to launch a successful kickstarter so long as the trends are kept in mind.
