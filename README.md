### Conclusion:
  According to the data, choosing a play(theater), is one of the most successful categories to be in. If you start in May, you will more than double your chances of success. If you start in the month of December, you will have about a 50% chance of a successful launch. Keeping your goal under $5000 gives you the best chances of success. A limitation of this dataset is that we only have data for years 2009 through 2017. Some other graphs we could look into is overlaying subcatagories.
