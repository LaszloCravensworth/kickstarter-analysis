# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scope of this project consisted of pulling data from years of successful and unsuccessful kickstarters. I ran different filters, looked at data through graphing, and created multiple spreadsheets. Everything worked together to create a clear and concise conclusion.

A limitation of this dataset is that we only have data for years 2009 through 2017, so it is a relatively small sample size. Some other graphs we could look into is overlaying subcatagories.
